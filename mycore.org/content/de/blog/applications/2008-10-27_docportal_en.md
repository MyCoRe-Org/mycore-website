DocPortal is a simple sample application of MyCoRe, which implements a publication server with typical Dublin Core 
metadata fields and the three object types "document", "author" and "institution".
This application is to be seen as an example and reference, by no means as a directly productively usable document 
server. But you can use DocPortal as a source system for the development of your own application
