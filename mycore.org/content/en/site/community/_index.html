      <h2>MyCoRe</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>MyCoRe</strong> is an <strong>open source project</strong>, that originated from the
        <strong>MILESS Project</strong> at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
      </p>
      <p>
         An association of developers from various German universities and university libraries are jointly developing the framework.
        This <a href="{{< ref team >}}">team</a> constitutes the <strong>MyCoRe Developer Community</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>How is the community organized?</h2>
      <p>
        As a professional open source project with great responsibility for the application it creates, it is
        helpful to use appropriate tools for team-driven development. The following figure shows an
        overview of the organizational structure and the tools used:

      <h2>MyCoRe Office</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>MyCoRe developer community</strong> has decided to install a business office to improve communication
         with the users, to coordinate the work and the external presentation of the project. 
         It should serve as the first point of contact for all interested parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The duties of the office include the organization of developer meetings and the user workshop. 
        How to reach the office is explained below <a href="{{< ref contact >}}#mycore-geschaeftsstelle">Contact</a>.
