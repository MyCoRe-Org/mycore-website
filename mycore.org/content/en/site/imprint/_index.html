 <h2>Legal Notice</h2>
 <em>Content</em><br />
  All content on our website has been carefully checked. We try to provide 
  the information up-to-date and in the correct and complete way. Nevertheless, 
  we cannot rule out that there are no mistakes. Also, we can not guarantee 
  the completeness, accuracy and timeliness. 
  <br />
  The content and information offered at www.mycore.de and www.mycore.org 
  may be changed, supplemented or removed at any time without prior notice 
  by the MyCoRe editorial office.

 <em>Liability for links</em><br />
 <p>Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over 
 whose contents we have no influence. The content of the linked pages are 
 the sole responsibility of the respective providers or operators of the 
 pages. At the time of linking, we checked the linked sites for possible 
 legal violations, and no illegal content was discernible. However, a 
 permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without 
 concrete evidence of a violation of law. Despite careful control, we assume 
 no liability for the content of external links. Should you nevertheless be 
 aware of any suspicious or dubious website content that is linked to from 
 the MyCoRe website, please let us know so that we can remove such links 
 immediately.
