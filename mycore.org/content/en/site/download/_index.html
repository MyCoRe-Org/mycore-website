  <h2>Snapshots and Releases</h2>
  <p>
    Every year, the development team prepares a so-called <a href="{{< ref path="release" lang="de" >}}">Long Term Support (LTS) Release</a>.
    It will be maintained and bugfixes will be provided for about one year until the next LTS release has been published. 
    In addition there will be annual releases for <strong>MIR</strong> and <strong>Skeleton</strong>. More
    information about the release management can be found in <a href="{{< ref path="release_docu" lang="de" >}}">developer documentation</a>.
   </p>
    
    
   <p>
       Older versions (releases and LTS-releases) are archived on GitHub and on the Maven repository.
       Old MyCoRe documentation may be found on the corresponding <code> mycore-website</code> branch on GitHub.

      <p>
      	The latest software code of MyCoRe core may be found on GitHub.  
        In addition some MyCoRe developers have opened their own repositories to share their components and applications: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/MyCoRe-Org">MyCoRe on GitHub</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ThULB">ThULB on GitHub</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://git.sc.uni-leipzig.de/mycore_applications">GitLab of the computer center at Leipzig university (URZ)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-5">MyCoRe</h2>
      <p>
        MyCoRe is no monolithic software. It offers a set of modules and components for creating your own repositories. 
        You may create customized applications by using only relevant components and modules. A list may be found 
        in section <a href="{{< ref path="basics_mcr_components" lang="de" >}}">MyCoRe core components</a> of the documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        MyCoRe components can be integrated via <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mycore/" target="_blank">Maven</a> <br />
        or cloned from <a href="https://github.com/MyCoRe-Org/mycore" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and built with the command <code>mvn clean install</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>MIR</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="{{< ref path="dl_mir/mir_release" lang="de" >}}">MIR</a> (the MyCoRe MODS Institutional Repository) is a complete, ready to use institutional repository software.
        It can be downloaded and installed in a few steps.
      </p>
